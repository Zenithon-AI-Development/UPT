## Unified Physics Transformer: Clean Version

This repo was created as an exact copy of src/ on 11/11/25, and I will be making several changes to the repo for improvements in clarity and usage. Done with the purpose of creating the foundation model and being able to easily use, without noise. Key areas of improvement:
- Reorganising repository
- Deleting unnecessary files
- Cleaning logs
- Adding time/compute cost for each part of the process
